Module defines loggers and counts 'logger.level' of logs for each logger.

Logger names and logger levels to be counted are defined in class variables of Logger class.

Whenever a message is loged with 'logger.level' the counter of 'logger.level' is increased by one.

A summary method in Logger class prints the counted 'logger.level'.
